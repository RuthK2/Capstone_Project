EXPENSE TRACKER API - PROJECT ROADMAP
=====================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
-----------------
An expense tracking REST API that allows users to manage their personal finances by tracking expenses across different categories with filtering capabilities.

MAIN FEATURES
-------------
1. User Authentication & Management
   - User registration/signup
   - User login/logout
   - JWT token-based authentication

2. Expense Management
   - Add new expenses
   - View all expenses
   - Update existing expenses
   - Delete expenses

3. Filtering & Analytics
   - Filter by time periods (weekly, monthly, last 3 months)
   - Filter by categories
   - Basic expense summaries

4. Category Management
   - Predefined categories: Groceries, Electricity, Utilities, Miscellaneous, Electronics, Clothing
   - Category-based expense organization

API ENDPOINTS STRUCTURE
-----------------------
Authentication:
- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/logout

Expenses:
- GET /api/expenses (with query params for filtering)
- POST /api/expenses
- PUT /api/expenses/:id
- DELETE /api/expenses/:id

Categories:
- GET /api/categories

TECHNOLOGY STACK
----------------
- Backend: Django with Django REST Framework (DRF)
- Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite (for development)
- Authentication: Django's built-in auth + JWT (djangorestframework-simplejwt)
- Validation: DRF serializers with built-in validation
- Testing: Django's TestCase and DRF APITestCase
- Documentation: DRF's built-in API documentation

DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE
--------------------

Week 1: Project Setup & Authentication (Days 1-7)
- Initialize Django project with DRF
- Set up PostgreSQL/SQLite database
- Create User model (extend AbstractUser if needed)
- Implement JWT authentication with djangorestframework-simplejwt
- Create registration and login endpoints
- Test user authentication

Week 2: Core Expense Management (Days 8-14)
- Create Expense and Category Django models
- Implement DRF ViewSets for CRUD operations
- Set up serializers for data validation
- Create URL patterns and routing
- Add basic permissions and validation
- Test expense operations

Week 3: Filtering & Advanced Features (Days 15-21)
- Implement Django QuerySet filtering (weekly, monthly, 3 months)
- Add category-based filtering using django-filter
- Create expense summary views with aggregation
- Implement DRF pagination
- Add custom validation and error handling

Week 4: Testing & Documentation (Days 22-28)
- Write Django unit tests and DRF API tests
- Create integration tests with APITestCase
- Set up DRF's automatic API documentation
- Database optimization with indexes
- Security enhancements and permissions

Week 5: Deployment & Final Polish (Days 29-35)
- Deploy to cloud platform (Heroku/PythonAnywhere/Railway)
- Configure production settings and environment variables
- Set up static files and database in production
- Final testing in production environment
- Create user documentation and code cleanup

DAILY WORK SCHEDULE
-------------------
- Days 1-2: Django project setup, virtual environment, DRF installation
- Days 3-4: Database configuration, User model setup, migrations
- Days 5-7: JWT authentication setup, registration/login views, testing

- Days 8-9: Expense and Category models, database relationships, migrations
- Days 10-11: DRF ViewSets, serializers for CRUD operations
- Days 12-14: URL routing, permissions, validation, error handling

- Days 15-16: Django QuerySet filtering by date ranges
- Days 17-18: Category filtering with django-filter, search functionality
- Days 19-21: Expense analytics with Django aggregation, DRF pagination

- Days 22-24: Django TestCase and APITestCase for all components
- Days 25-26: Integration tests, DRF API documentation setup
- Days 27-28: Security testing, database optimization, performance tuning

- Days 29-30: Production deployment setup, settings configuration
- Days 31-32: Production testing, environment variables, bug fixes
- Days 33-35: Documentation, final polish, project presentation

MILESTONES
----------
- End of Week 1: Working authentication system
- End of Week 2: Complete expense CRUD operations
- End of Week 3: Full filtering and analytics features
- End of Week 4: Tested and documented API
- End of Week 5: Deployed and production-ready application

SUCCESS CRITERIA
-----------------
- Users can register and authenticate securely
- Full expense management (add, view, edit, delete)
- Effective filtering by time periods and categories
- Clean, well-documented API
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Successfully deployed and accessible

POTENTIAL CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS
--------------------------------
- Database design complexity → Start with simple Django models, use migrations
- Authentication security → Use djangorestframework-simplejwt best practices
- Date filtering logic → Leverage Django QuerySet date lookups
- API performance → Implement DRF pagination and database indexing
- Testing coverage → Write tests alongside development using Django's testing framework

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Post-MVP)
------------------------------
- Budget setting and tracking
- Expense receipt image uploads
- Data export functionality
- Mobile app integration
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Multi-currency support
